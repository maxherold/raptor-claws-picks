<h1>How These Picks Can Benefit Your Playing</h1>
<p>By giving a guitar pick a slight edge, or "claw," it can grasp onto
    the strings better, giving a fuller, livlier sound. The plectrums
     come in two sizes, 1.14 mm, and 2.00 mm. The former is often
      chosen for both instruments, but those who use bass picks will
       find a comfortable and familiar feel with our thicker plectrum. Down below,
        you will see images of both picks.. used- how we like them (1.14 in blue, 2.00 in green). The claws
         are in-focus so you can see what I mean!
